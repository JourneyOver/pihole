### ðŸŽ® Blocking Twitch Ads

For blocking Twitch ads, I use [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) along with the [AdGuard Extra Userscript](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardExtra?tab=readme-ov-file#adguard-extra). This userscript enhances uBlock Origin by helping block server-side ads.
